* We are looking for help writing the architecture tips in every folder of our templates.
  - We've implemented what we've learned in the IDDD, Clean Architecture and Building Microservices books. It is a must read for this task.
* Check the scripts and generated templates.  
* Any feedback though issues.
* Pull requests for new adapters (Dapper, Entity Framework, Azure Event Hubs) are welcome!
